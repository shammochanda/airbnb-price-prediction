# airbnb-price-prediction
### london_weekends_prediction.ipynb: 
  - This is a rough, slightly disorganized attempt at predicting AirBnB prices and presenting data only for London weekends
  - The small amount of data for just London weekends probably hindered the quality of the prediction
  - Data was augmented by scraping websites for the busiest tourist attractions and metro stations, and then calculating distances from the AirBnB to these points
  - Images for map representation obtained from OpenStreetMap.org
  - To view code that may have been cut off in Github's view of the notebook, the notebook can be viewed here with the Google Colaboratory application on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ds78_taQU8kgK1xl6e_NIIAy7SzfOCFK/view?usp=sharing

### european_airbnb_price_analysis.ipynb:
  - This notebook explores the whole dataset, containing data from AirBnBs on weekdays and weekends across 10 European cities
  - This is a cleaner and more coherent notebook.
  - It includes data cleaning, EDA, and prediction, as well as interpretations obtained from the prediction and analysis steps
  - Diagrams and analyses are presented with a logical flow meant for easy consumption of data for subsequent business-side use

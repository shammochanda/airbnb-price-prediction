# airbnb-price-prediction
### london_weekends_prediction.ipynb: 
  - This is a rough, slightly disorganized attempt at predicting AirBnB prices and presenting data only for London weekends
  - The small amount of data for just London weekends probably hindered the quality of the prediction
  - Data was augmented by scraping websites for the busiest tourist attractions and metro stations, and then calculating distances from the AirBnB to these points
  - Images for map representation obtained from OpenStreetMap.org
  - To view code that may have been cut off in Github's view of the notebook, the notebook can be viewed here with the Google Colaboratory application on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ds78_taQU8kgK1xl6e_NIIAy7SzfOCFK/view?usp=sharing
  - You can also access the notebook via nbviewer: https://nbviewer.org/github/shammochanda/airbnb-price-prediction/blob/main/london_weekends_prediction.ipynb

### european_airbnb_price_analysis.ipynb:
  - This notebook explores the whole dataset, containing data from AirBnBs on weekdays and weekends across 10 European cities
  - This is a cleaner and more coherent notebook.
  - It includes data cleaning, EDA, and prediction, as well as interpretations obtained from the prediction and analysis steps
  - Diagrams and analyses are presented with a logical flow meant for easy consumption of data for subsequent business-side use
  - To view code that may have been cut off in Github's view of the notebook, the notebook can be viewed here with the Google Colaboratory application on Google Drive: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O9mfpqny8TxoV8rs0_bLlRlqcKQobZG8?usp=sharing
  - Due to the size of the file, the notebook will not be rendered on github. The notebook can be viewed using nbviewer: https://nbviewer.org/github/shammochanda/airbnb-price-prediction/blob/main/european_airbnb_price_analysis.ipynb

### airbnb_plotly_viz.ipynb:
  - This notebook is only for dynamic plotly visuals of European AirBnBs
  - Created to avoid clutter in european_airbnb_price_analysis.ipynb notebook
  - Dynamic Plotly Visuals can only be viewed using nbviewer
  - The interactivity of the notebook can only be accessed through nbviewer (there may be some issues with the rendering of some of the maps, which I am working on fixing)
  - Link to nbviewer here: https://nbviewer.org/github/shammochanda/airbnb-price-prediction/blob/main/airbnb_plotly_viz.ipynb

# airbnb-price-prediction
### london_weekends_prediction.ipynb: 
  - This is a rough, slightly disorganized attempt at predicting AirBnB prices and presenting data only for London weekends
  - The small amount of data for just London weekends probably hindered the quality of the prediction
  - Data was augmented by scraping websites for the busiest tourist attractions and metro stations, and then calculating distances from the AirBnB to these points
  - Images for map representation obtained from OpenStreetMap.org


Dataset obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities
